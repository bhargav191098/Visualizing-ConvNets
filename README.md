# Visualizing-ConvNets

I wanted to try out the code that Francois wrote for visualizing what the convNets learn. I used Pytorch and the Cifar-10 dataset.
The repository has two networks - the standard pytorch site code training for cifar-10, that gave 59% accuracy (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) and the second network is partly VGG-16 arch kinda network.
I have just added the visualising the convolutional layers for now. Will be committing the activation maps part of the chapter in a later commit.
